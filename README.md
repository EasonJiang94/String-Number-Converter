# String To Number
## Problem Definition
It's a text-number converter. For example : 
```
input : fifty-five
output : 55
input : one hundred two million twenty-one
output : 102000021
```
The input range is [0, 10^9-1].

The input always is a string type, and the output should be a integer.

The rule of converting text to number follows the website : [Number-To-Word](https://codebeautify.org/number-to-word-converter)

## Envirornment
python >= 3.8 I think
## Run the test
```bash=1
git clone https://github.com/EasonJiang94/String-Number-Converter.git
cd String-Number-Converter
python run.py
```
The output would be like : 
```
----python run.py  
Test Case Running : 02384853/1000000000 two million three hundred eighty-four thousand eight hundred fifty-three           
```
The amount of testing case is from zero to (1e9-1). It takes few minutes.
